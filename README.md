# qb-deliveryjob
A simple delivery job that uses an app in my qb-phone to manage.


### Special Note
This script may or may not be plug-and-play with whatever framework/server you are using. I will not be providing support for this. Best of luck.


### Features
 - Deliver items to locations in the specified amount of time to get paid
 - Phone app integration, via [my qb-phone](https://github.com/JoeSzymkowiczFiveM/qb-phone)
